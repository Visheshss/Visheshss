## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 

Hi, Iâ€™m Vishesh Suthar, a Software Engineering student at McMaster University! I love web development and have been teaching myself to code over the last two years. I enjoy building projects because they are the perfect opportunity to learn something new while building something that interests me. 

## What I'm working on right now: ValoStats

Currently, I'm learning react.js through working on GameBud, a website that acts as a free-to-play game database. It will allow the user to search for a variety of free-to-play games by keyword and genre, and they can then find a summary of the game and a link to download. Users will also be able to review and rate games that they have played.
