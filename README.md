## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 

Hi, Iâ€™m Vishesh Suthar, a Software Engineering student at McMaster University! I currently do web development and have been teaching myself to code over the last two years. I enjoy building projects because they are the perfect opportunity to learn something new while building something that interests me. 

## What I'm working on right now: ValoStats

Currently, I'm working on ValoStats, a web application using Flask on the backend and React.js on the frontend. The site allows users to view recent match/MMR history for any given player along with general information such as the player's current rank, name, and profile picture. For recent matches, player stats in specific matches can also be viewed in addition to other details like selected agent, map, and score. MMR history is graphed using Chart.js for easy viewing.
