- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Visheshss
I'm interested in web development, specifically with python, javascript, html, css, and sql. 
Currently, I'm learning react.js through working on a website that acts as a free-to-play game database. This project also uses flask, html, css, and sql.

Most recently, I built a website that uses the spotify api to display users' most listened to tracks and artists. Furthermore, it creates a brand new 
playlist based on most listened to artists, genres, and tracks for the user.
